Several months ago I gave a lightning-talk at [Jama Software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/) about ["The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers"](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073), a book on professionalism for software engineers by [Robert C. Martin](https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/) (Uncle Bob) that is a follow up to his classic book ["Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882).  

<!--description-->

At Jama, our engineering group holds [lightning talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) once per [sprint](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/iteration/)  (every 2 weeks), where anyone in the organization invited to present on any topic (though they usually have a technical bent) for four minutes and forty seconds.  This event serves as a great way to share individual areas of continuous learning.  Given these constraints, this lightning talk just served to introduce the main premise of the book, and underscore one part that I thought was particularly useful and salient to my fellow software engineers.

The Clean Coder discusses the soft skills that that a professional in software development needs in order to be successful in their line of work.  These topics range with how to deal with conflicts, schedule pressures, management issues, to time-management and gumption traps.  All this to help answer the question of how we can keep not only our code clean, but the interpersonal interactions surrounding it.

The topic I chose to focus on for the balance of the lightning talk was Martin's discussion of the importance of saying "No", especially within the context of planning software projects.  

Saying no when it is the right thing to do is an immensely important thing to do as a software professional.  As Martin explains, saying **no** to something is often far less costly than saying yes to something when yes was the wrong answer.  This can be costly in terms of dollars lost by the business, and also in terms of a software engineer's professional reputation.  

In software organizations that follow Agile software development methodology, we are expected to regularly estimate the time it will take to complete a development task during sprint planning.  This helps inform the estimated release schedule for the project, which is important information for stakeholders on the customer-facing side of the business.  This serves as a way to help Product Owners and stakeholders understand the cost of investing time in a particular set of features for the software, and is often the point at which saying "yes" or "no" is most important.

The agile planning process involves the Product Owner and the Delivery team working together to estimate and commit to stories.  This is often referred to as a friendly adversarial relationship, as it can involve some tense discussions about the reality of the time required for a feature and the expected timeline for the customer.
