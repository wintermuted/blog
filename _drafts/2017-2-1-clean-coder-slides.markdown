Several months ago I gave a lightning-talk at [Jama Software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/) about ["The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers"](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073), a book on professionalism for software engineers by [Robert C. Martin](https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/) (Uncle Bob) that is a follow up to his classic book ["Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882).  

<!--description-->

At Jama, our engineering group holds [lightning talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) once per sprint (every 2 weeks), where anyone in the organization invited to present on any topic (though they usually have a technical bent) for four minutes and forty seconds.  Given these constraints, this lightning talk just served to introduce the main premise of the book, and underscore one part that I thought was particularly useful and salient to my fellow software engineers.

The Clean Coder discusses the soft skills that that a professional in software development needs in order to be successful in their line of work.  These topics range with how to deal with conflicts, schedule pressures, management issues, to time-management and gumption traps.

The topic I chose to focus on for the balance of the lightning talk was Martin's discussion of the importance of saying "No", especially within the context of planning software projects.  

As Martin explains, saying **no** to something is often far less costly than saying yes to something.  Unfortunately, software engineers often find themselves saying yes that they may not necessarily be able to commit to, but do so anyways out of fear of losing face.  Saying yes is a commitment, and when you commit to something that you are unsure that you can deliver on
