This helps inform the estimated release schedule for the project, which is important information for stakeholders on the customer-facing side of the business.  This serves as a way to help Product Owners and stakeholders understand the cost of investing time in a particular set of features for the software, and is often the point at which saying "yes" or "no" is most important.

The agile planning process involves the Product Owner and the Delivery team working together to estimate and commit to stories.  This is often referred to as a friendly adversarial relationship, as it can involve some tense discussions about the reality of the time required for a feature and the expected timeline for the customer.
