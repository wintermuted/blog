## Our dependence on electricity

Another reflection was that our lifestyle & livelihoods depend heavily upon a steady source of electricity.  This was of course self-obvious, but it was bleakly apparent with the extended lack of access to that resource.  Our power had never been out longer than 6 hours previously.  We are not adequately prepared for a situation where our power is out for multiple days, as it was in this instance.  

Without access to electricity that we draw from the municipal grid, we are unable to heat or cool our home, run our refrigerators & freezers, charge devices, or utilize our internet. Once we've reached the threshold of a day, we have the additional worry about food chilled in our refrigerator spoiling, and the frozen food (primarily meats) in our freezer defrosting.  

Given that it is winter, we also needed to be concerned about heating.  Fortunately our home has a workable fireplace that was an available option and winters in Portland are fairly mild.  However, after a few days of use this was also a problem, as it was negatively impacting the air quality of our pre-war home, which was having a negative impact on our lungs.

### Learnings

Our dependence on electricity is an integral part of the professions we have chosen, but also part of the society we live in.  Without this resource we are unable to perform many of the activities we take for granted.  This experience provided an opportunity for us to examine our preparedness and resilence in these situations.

When disruptions to the public electricity grid occur, we can either adapt to the situation or prepare for the possibility of it by ensuring that we have continued access to electricity in some form.

#### Adapting

Adapting to the situation was easy, as we were reasonably prepared for it.  Over the years we've collected a healthy amount of camping gear, and as a result we had many helpful tools that allowed to cook food and light our house at night with battery-powered camping lamps.

#### Preparing

In the event of another long period of outage, another route is to provide an electricity source of our own to power our home or auxillary power to devices.  

Accompishing this would likely mean making an investment in a fuel-powered generator, battery backup system, or solar power, and upgrading our electrical system of our home.  Any of these options would require a large monetary investment.

#### Changing

A third, but more difficult option is for us to alter our relationship with electricity.  Given how entrenched we are in depending upon electricity, this is no small feat, and therefore something we will not be able to accompish in one fell swoop.  

Despite the daunting challenge, it is a fun problem solving exercise to engage in.  With it we will need to examine how we use electricity; what is essential and what is not; what alternatives are available.  I'm looking forward to learning more about this and finding novel solutions to it.
