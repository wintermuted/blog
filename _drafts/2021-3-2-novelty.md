## Novelty

While the weekend was filled with quite a bit of stress, but it was also filled with novelty which served as a welcome break to the monotony that has come with working from home for nearly a year.  As we were going through this experience, we realized how much appreciation we had for the situation, despite it's inconvenience.

### One year of solitude

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020 in America, both of our employers decided to close their offices to employees and transition to indefinite work-from-home.  At the time of writing, we are nearly upon the one year anniversary of this change.  Recent positive developments with vaccines has caused the estimated timeline of us being able able to return to our offices at the end of 2021. 

Our shift to full-time remote work was initially a welcomed one; we enjoyed being able to spend more time together, not having to commute to an office, and being able to make more use of our home.  I had been working from home part time on my own volition previous to it becoming a necessity.  For Rachel the shift to remote work was indeed a novelty, given her culture of her company putting heavy value on in-person collaboration.

During the warmer months, this was a quite pleasant arrangement.   We were able spend time working outside, and once the work day was over, still have sunlight to spare.  As the days have grown shorter and wetter, we moved into a predictable cycle that we have grown accustomed to in Portland during the fall and winter; spending a lot more time inside.  

In previous years, this was regularly puncuated with our commute to work, regular happy hours with friends, and other activities.  With diminished access to the outdoors as we work, and the lack of the company of friends, we started to devolve into a montonous schedule that primarily revolved around work.

### Learnings

Though losing power & wireless connectivity was an inconvenience, we both enjoyed the fact that it forced us to get away from our computers and mobile devices and instead spend time in front of the fire with each other.

Despite enjoying the change of pace for a few days, we became tired enough to be ready for a change of situation, especially since we had no idea when our power would return.  We had the privelege of being able to take a short trip outside of town, which we were greatful to have.
