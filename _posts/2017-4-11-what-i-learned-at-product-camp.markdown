Last month I attended ProductCamp Portland for the first time.  I had heard about Product Camp a few times since I began working at Jama over two years ago - a thing that I can attribute to the strong product culture we have - but had never had much interest in attending.  Many had attended (not necessarily on the engineering side of the house) and one had even been nominated for best talk a few years ago.

Over the past year or so, I became more interested in Agile Software Development, started serving as a Scrum Master for a feature-development team, and became a Certified Scrum Master.  This of course involved working closely with the Product Management team that we have at Jama, and many questions about the most efficient and beneficial relationship between engineering and product folks.  I figured it was probably high-time that I take off my engineering hat for a day and pretend I was a Product Manager, both for the sake of empathy towards my product-development peers and my own professional growth.

On March 4th, I showed up at the Eliot Center in Downtown Portland, where this year's conference was being held. During my day at ProductCamp I didn't learn much about the nuts and bolts of what it takes to be a great Product Manager, but I did get the opportunity to learn a few things about the Product Development perspective on software products.  ProductCamp is a conference that doesn't have predetermined speakers; instead during a morning session topics are pitched, and voted on by the attendees, and finally filled into the schedule across four sessions.  After this attendees choose which sessions they would like to attend.  I missed the early-morning selection routine, but showed up in time for the commencement of the initial talks.

One of the more interesting talks that I attended was on the [Agile Fluency](http://www.agilefluency.org/) model was facilitated by Diana Larson, an Agile trainer and local celebrity in Portland's Software Development industry (full-disclosure, Diana facilitated a retrospective workshop at Jama a little over two years ago).  In this session, Larson explained the Agile Fluency model, and discussed with the attendees.  I found this talk particularly germane to my own experiences of attempting to understand and improve our Agile Software development capabilities at Jama.  If anything, it made me at peace with accepting that there is no one right way to do Agile, and that each organization goes through a progression that takes time and care to execute on.

# Agile Fluency Model

The Agile Fluency model was developed by Diana Larson and James Shore, another luminary in the local software development industry.  It was initially introduced in the article [Your Path through Agile Fluency](https://martinfowler.com/articles/agileFluency.html) on Martin Fowler's website five years ago authored by Larson & Shore.   The model is used to describe the stages that a team goes through as they develop fluency with Agile Software development, and is used to "chart a course for the team, create alignment with management, and secure organizational support for improvement."   

In order to describe fluency, the "star" model is used.  While this describes levels of progression insofar as fluency with Agile methodologies as a team, they [do not](https://www.infoq.com/articles/agile-fluency-fit-purpose) describe it as a maturity model like CMMI.  Instead it should be understood that the goal for each team should not to be to reach the final tier, but to aspire to the level that is most appropriate for their organization.
