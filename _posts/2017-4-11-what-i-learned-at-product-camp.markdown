Last month I attended ProductCamp Portland for the first time.  I had heard about Product Camp a few times since I began working at Jama over two years ago - a thing that I can attribute to the strong product culture we have - but had never had much interest in attending.  Many had attended (not necessarily on the engineering side of the house) and one had even been nominated for best talk a few years ago.

Over the past year or so, I became more interested in Agile Software Development, started serving as a Scrum Master for a feature-development team, and became a Certified Scrum Master.  This of course involved working closely with the Product Management team that we have at Jama, and many questions about the most efficient and beneficial relationship between engineering and product folks.  I figured it was probably high-time that I take off my engineering hat for a day and pretend I was a Product Manager, both for the sake of empathy towards my product-development peers and my own professional growth.

At ProductCamp I didn't learn too much about the nuts and bolts of what it takes to be a great Product Manager, but I did get the opportunity to learn a few things about the Product Development perspective on software products.  ProductCamp is a conference that doesn't have predetermined speakers; instead during a morning session topics are pitched, and voted on by the attendees, and the filled into the schedule.  After this attendees choose which sessions they would like to attend.  I missed the early-morning selection routine, but showed up in time for the commencement of the initial talks.

- List out and describe the three talks that I attended.
- Sum up my experience.
