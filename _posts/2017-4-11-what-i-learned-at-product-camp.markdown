Last month I attended ProductCamp Portland for the first time.  I had heard about Product Camp a few times since I began working at Jama over two years ago - a thing that I can attribute to the strong product culture we have - but had never had much interest in attending.  Many had attended (not necessarily on the engineering side of the house) and one had even been nominated for best talk a few years ago.

Over the past year or so, I became more interested in Agile Software Development, started serving as a Scrum Master for a feature-development team, and became a Certified Scrum Master.  This of course involved working closely with the Product Management team that we have at Jama, and many questions about the most efficient and beneficial relationship between engineering and product folks.  I figured it was probably high-time that I take off my engineering hat for a day and pretend I was a Product Manager, both for the sake of empathy towards my product-development peers and my own professional growth.

On March 4th, I showed up at the Eliot Center in Downtown Portland, where this year's conference was being held. During my day at ProductCamp I didn't learn much about the nuts and bolts of what it takes to be a great Product Manager, but I did get the opportunity to learn a few things about the Product Development perspective on software products.  ProductCamp is a conference that doesn't have predetermined speakers; instead during a morning session topics are pitched, and voted on by the attendees, and finally filled into the schedule across four sessions.

I attended four talks in total, most of which dealt with how a either how a Product Manager can more effectively work with stakeholders, and also those which below

# Agile Fluency Model

One of the more interesting talks that I attended was on the Agile Fluency model was facilitated by Diana Larson, an Agile trainer and local celebrity in Portland's Software Development industry (full-disclosure, Diana facilitated a retrospective workshop at Jama a little over two years ago).  

The Agile Fluency model was developed by Diana Larson and James Shore, another luminary in the local software development industry.  The model is used to describe the stages that a team goes through as they develop fluency with Agile Software development.  The model describes four distinct stages that a team goes through as they move along in their understanding and integration into Agile Software Development methodologies.

In order to describe fluency, the "star" model was used
