The prior weekend was filled with a number of holidays.  On Friday we welcomed the [Year of Ox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ox_(zodiac)) with [Lunar New Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_New_Year), Sunday was [Valentines Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Valentine%27s_Day), and Monday was [President's Day](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Washington%27s_Birthday) in America.

Of these holidays, Lunar New Year is the only one of major importance to my partner and I.  Valentines Day is a good excuse to make or eat a very nice meal and President's Day is merely a public holiday that is part of America's [civic religion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_religion), which means a free day off to some workers.

Despite there being a number of holidays we planned to celebrate in various ways, it was also a weekend of serendipity, as a result of the winter storm that passed through Portland.

## Lunar New Year

Lunar New Year has significance because my partner is [Chinese American](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Americans).  Her family grew up celebrating the holiday every year, and as we became a couple I was included in those traditions as well.  For me its become a fun way to mark a new year, and is an important part of our shared traditions as an [intercultural couple](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interracial_marriage).

Since moving to Portland we've alternated between traveling to Los Angeles to celebrate with her family and celebrating up here with friends and coworkers.  This year was quite different because we were unable to celebrate with anyone in-person due to the ongoing [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic).  Last year we traveled to Los Angeles to celebrate right before the pandemic became apparent.

There are various activities associated with Lunar New Year, but one the most important parts for my partner is the foods we eat.  The morning of Lunar New Year we eat a vegetarian meal to give the animals a break.  In the evening we eat a bigger meal that typically includes crab, fish, and pork.

## The storm

Beginning on Friday we received a lot of snow in [Portland](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland,_Oregon) and the northwest Oregon as a result of a winter storm.  We typically only get a signficant amount of snow in the city once or twice a year.  Having lived the entirety of my life prior to moving to Oregon in southern California,  I've looked forward to any major innundation of snow.  However, seven years in I've also grown to appreciate how poorly the city and its people collectively are able to deal with the impact of snow.

By Saturday morning we had enough snow to allow us to go snowshoeing around the neighborhood with our dog Sophie.  We visted the nearby city park and found a large group of families from the neighorhood sledding down the hillside and having a great time.  This was a fun sight to see in the midst of the pandemic and winter, when it is typically overcast and rainy.

Sophie is a big fan of the snow, and had a fun time exploring and walking around the neightborhood.

## The aftermath

Unfortunately, by Sunday night the weather had evolved into [freezing rain](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freezing_rain).  Freezing rain is more common occurrence in Oregon during the winter months, and when paired with snow can lead to some disastorous effects.  These effects primarily have an impact in weighing down trees to the point where they fall over or split in half due to the added weight of the snow & ice on their limbs.  

The culmination of snow and ice over the weekend led to exactly that, toppling numerous trees around the region, which subsequently took down nearby powerlines, which led to a series of power outages in the region that left more than [150,000 people](https://apnews.com/article/portland-power-outages-oregon-fd52ad7b5b7e4d693ab58428f7bc1c3c), including ourselves, without power for a number of days.  This occurred at the same time as the much more severe weather and power outages effecting Texas.

### Power outage

Our power went out on Sunday evening, and did not end up coming back on until midday Tuesday.  Our neighbors across the street in Southwest Portland draw power from a different aerial than ours, and were without power for a few days prior to the ice storm that eventually did the city in.  Both myself and my partner were aware of coworkers and friends-of-friends who were without power for much longer. 

With the power being out, things started to become quite cold, and the food in our refrigerator started to warm up and our freezer started to defrost.  Fortunately, we have a fireplace in our home that we were able to use to keep ourselves warm at night, and a good collection of camping gear that we were able to use to put to good use.  On Monday morning we woke up still without power, so we decided to take out some of our gear to make coffee and breakfast on our front porch.

## Out to the coast

By Monday night both of our mobile phones stopped working, and by Tuesday morning needing to get back to work, and still not having power or reliable internet access, we decided to take a cue from our neighbor and head out of Portland to the Oregon Coast.  We decided to head out to [Pacific City](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_City,_Oregon), a favourite destination of ours.

We traveled on [Oregon Route 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oregon_Route_6) to reach Pacific City.  This route takes you from the [Willamette Valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willamette_Valley), where Portland is located, across the [Northern Oregon Coast Range](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northern_Oregon_Coast_Range) of mountains to the coast.  The trip typically takes us between 1 1/2 to 2 hours to complete.

As we travelled along the highway we were able to clearly see the devastation the storm had also wreaked in the [Tillamook State Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tillamook_State_Forest).  From the highway you could see that numerous trees had fallen down, large limbs had cracked, and some trees had split in two.  This seemed to have mostly impacted the [Alder](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alnus_rubra) (*Alnus rubra*) trees that grow alongside the fir trees in the forest.

As we crossed through the coastal range, it was clear that some parts of the highway were starting to slide out, though not bad enough to make drivng dangerous at the time.

## Reflections

As a result of our experience over this weekend, and the impromtu roadtrip that it concluded with, I realized a few things our present situation of living and working entirely at home for nearly a year.

### Novelty is a necessity & can be a privelege

The weekend was filled with quite a bit of stress, but it was also filled with novelty which served as a welcome break to the monotony that has come with working from home for nearly a year.  #Though losing power was an inconvenience, we both enjoyed the fact that it forced us to get away from our computers and mobile devices and instead spend time in front of the fire / and lighting candles to see our way around at night.

Despite enjoying the change of pace for a few days, we became tired enough to be ready for a change of situation, especially since we had no idea when our power would return.  We had the privelege of being able to take a short trip outside of town, which we were greatful to have.

### Our dependence on electricity

Another reflection was that our lifestyle & livelihoods depend heavily upon a steady source of electricity.  This was of course self-obvious, but it was bleakly apparent with the extended lack of access to that resource.  Our power had never been out longer than 6 hours previously.  We are not adequately prepared for a situation where our power is out for multiple days, as it was in this instance.  

Without access to electricity that we draw from the municipal grid, we are unable to heat or cool our home, run our refrigerators & freezers, charge devices, or utilize our internet. Once we've reached the threshold of a day, we have the additional worry about food chilled in our refrigerator spoiling, and the frozen food (primarily meats) in our freezer defrosting.  

Given that it is winter, we also needed to be concerned about heating.  Fortunately our home has a workable fireplace that was an available option and winters in Portland are fairly mild.  However, after a few days of use this was also a problem, as it was negatively impacting the air quality of our pre-war home, which was having a negative impact on our lungs.

#### Learnings

Our dependence on electricity is an integral part of the professions we have chosen, but also part of the society we live in.  Without this resource we are unable to perform many of the activities we take for granted.  This experience provided an opportunity for us to examine our preparedness and resilence in these situations.

When disruptions to the public electricity grid occur, we can either adapt to the situation or prepare for the possibility of it by ensuring that we have continued access to electricity in some form.

##### Adapting

Adapting to the situation was easy, as we were reasonably prepared for it.  Over the years we've collected a healthy amount of camping gear, and as a result we had many helpful tools that allowed to cook food and light our house at night with battery-powered camping lamps.

##### Preparing

In the event of another long period of outage, another route is to provide an electricity source of our own to power our home or auxillary power to devices.  

Accompishing this would likely mean making an investment in a fuel-powered generator, battery backup system, or solar power, and upgrading our electrical system of our home.  Any of these options would require a large monetary investment.

##### Changing

A third, but more difficult option is for us to alter our relationship with electricity.  Given how entrenched we are in depending upon electricity, this is no small feat, and therefore something we will not be able to accompish in one fell swoop.  

Despite the daunting challenge, it is a fun problem solving exercise to engage in.  With it we will need to examine how we use electricity; what is essential and what is not; what alternatives are available.  I'm looking forward to learning more about this and finding novel solutions to it.
