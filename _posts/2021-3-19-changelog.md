## Summary of changes

This set of changes includes primarily cosmetic changes, some organizational changes in the weblog, and some new content for the homepage!

### Design
* Dark mode is now darker!  Coloring is better aligned with Github's dark mode.  I'm planning on later adding the ability to switch this on the fly.
* Light mode receives some fixes.
* The title bar now includes a crescent moon glyph in the logo.

### Organization
* Weblog posts now use `Category` metadata to organize them by type.  Each post will have a single category, which is currently `journal`, `essay`, `travelouge`, `changelog` or `presentation`.  The `tags` meta can contain mulitiple entries, and is used to organize posts by topic.
* Each weblog post category now has a dedicated page.

### Features
* The [homepage](/) now includes recent entries from the [Weblog](/weblog), in sections that separate them by Journal, Essays, Talks (presentations), and Changelogs
