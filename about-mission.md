<p class="lead">
I see my primary mission as attempting to leave things in a better state than I found them, and to do so in a way
uplifts all those involved. I am an average person with average means, and though I know I won't necessarily change the
world, I think it's important to have a positive impact upon my community and those in it.

In my professional life, this mission sees action in the way I approach problem solving and collaborating with others in
shared endeavors.
