## The Golden Mean - Don't let perfect be the enemy of good

Achieving perfection is often impossible with any complex task, and effort beyond what is actually necessary in
achieving its main purpose results in diminishing returns. The best and most efficient way to accomplish to goal is to
accept that it only needs to be "good" enough to fulfill the purpose it was meant to serve. This does not mean that we
shouldn't strive for the best outcome or the highest quality; but that we shouldn't let that impede our ability to
initially benefit from the fruits of our labour.

## Kaizen ~ Continuous Improvement

_Kaizen_ is a concept referring to the process of continuous, incremental improvements to a system. I see Kaizen as
necessary a colophon to `Don't let perfect be the enemy of good.' Any process, design, or thing can always be improved
if desired. Improving it is most effective when it is an iterative process that depends upon reflection and constructive
analysis of the choices and circumstances that led to its current state.

## Sustainable Design & Development

In it's simplest definition, sustainability is the ability of something to exist constantly. Sustainability is an
important part of my personal & professional outlook. It drives my motivation to eliminate waste & inefficiency, and
build with eye towards the long term results of an endeavor.
