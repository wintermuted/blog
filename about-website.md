<p class="lead">
I maintain this website as a personal & professional weblog and wiki.  
</p>

Topics I focus on are software engineering practice, and outdoor recreation within the Pacific Northwest.  

I no longer maintain any personal social media profiles, and find a lot of comfort in a nostalgia for earlier days of the internet where weblogs were more abundant.  This website given me an opportunity to return to my roots by hand coding.
