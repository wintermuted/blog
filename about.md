I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Xandr](https://www.xandr.com), an advertising & analytics division
of [WarnerMedia](https://www.warnermedia.com/us). I lead a team focused on building products for businesses managing
advertising for publishers.

I live and work in Portland, Oregon, where I have been located since 2013. Prior to relocating to the Pacific Northwest,
I lived in southern California.

## Mission

I see my primary mission as attempting to leave things in a better state than I found them, and to do so in a way
uplifts all those involved. I am an average person with average means, and though I know I won't necessarily change the
world, I think it's important to have a positive impact upon my community and those in it.

In my professional life, this mission sees action in the way I approach problem solving and collaborating with others in
shared endeavors.
