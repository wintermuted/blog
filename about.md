<p class="lead">
Hello, I'm Jameson Nyeholt, and I live in Portland, Oregon.
</p>

<p class="lead">
I currently work in at <a href="https://www.xandr.com">Xandr, Inc.</a> as a Senior Software Engineer.<br/>
I spend my free time with my family exploring the <a href="/wiki/cascadia/">Pacific Northwest</a>.<br/>
When I'm not doing that, I have some hobbies, which includes maintaining this weblog.

<!-- I relocated to the [Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest) in 2013.  Previously, I lived in [southern 
California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California), where I was born, raised, and educated. -->
