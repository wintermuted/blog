<p class="lead">
Hello, I'm Jameson, and I am an American software engineer based in Portland, Oregon.
</p>

## Current status

I am a Senior Software Engineer at [Xandr](https://www.xandr.com), an advertising & analytics division
of [WarnerMedia](https://www.warnermedia.com/us). I lead a team focused on building products for businesses managing
advertising for publishers.

## Background

Prior to relocating to the [Pacific Northwest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pacific_Northwest), I lived in [southern 
California](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Southern_California), where I was born, raised, and educated.

I am self-taught software engineer.  Despite pursuing an undergraduate degree in 
[Political Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Political_science), I spent much of my teenage through college years 
experimenting with web-development & various programming languages.  Ultimately, I think I'm a lot happier than I 
would have been as a lawyer or government professional, and appreciate the challenges, creativity, and privileges that 
my career affords me.

I've spent most of my career working for enterprise software companies in the SaaS, 
[Product Lifecycle Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product_lifecycle), and 
[digital advertising](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Online_advertising) spaces.

## Professional focus

My primary technical focus tends to be front-end web engineering; I occasionally spend some time writing backend services, 
but my primary passion is in building great user experiences for complex tasks.



In the present era of my career I spend a majority of my time providing technical and team leadership to my colleagues.  To 
this end I'm often spending more time helping scale tools and organizational processes than I am implementing user stories.
