I'm currently living and working in beautiful Portland, Oregon as a software engineer at Jama Software.

I am a big proponent of **software craftsmanship** and **agile methodologies**.  I enjoy working in environments that support Test-Driven-Development and pair-programming.  In my experience as a software engineer, I have programmed using Javascript, Java, Python & Scala, and have developed user-interfaces, REST end-points, and tooling.

In my free time, you can find me enjoying the outdoors via camping, surfing, hiking, or long road-trips with my wife Rachel.
