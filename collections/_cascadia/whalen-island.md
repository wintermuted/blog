<p class="lead">
Whalen Island is a sandy, forested island surrounded by the Sand Lake tidal estuary that sits roughly 1.6 kilometers from the ocean and several miles north of Pacific City on the North Coast of Oregon. 
</p>

Whalen Island includes the [Clay Myers State Natural Area](https://stateparks.oregon.gov/index.cfm?do=park.profile&parkId=168) and a Tillamook County Campground.  There are numerous other natural areas and to explore within a short drive.

It is one of our favorite places to camp and explore on the Oregon Coast.  It contains an abundance of natural beauty and opportunities for outdoor recreation.  We tend to visit once or twice a year, traditionally to celebrate Rachel's birthday with friends.

Being a tidal estuary, Whalen Island is a host to a dynamic ecosystem that host a wide variety of plant & animal life.  It makes for a beautiful place to passively observe nature, and a great place to responsibly use nature as a resource.

### Hiking

Whalen Island is host to a 1.5 mile hiking trail loop via the Clay Myers day-use area.  Aside from the designated trail, you can easily cut your own trail through non-protected areas along the estuary.

There are several desginated hiking trails that can also be found at some of the [Nearby natural areas](#nearby-destinations).

### Kayaking & Boating

Kayaking & Boating are permitted within the estuary, however it's shallow depth at low tide does not always make boating with a motor plausible.  The Whalen Island County Campground includes a gravel boat launch where it is possible to launch a small boat, canoe, or kayak. 

We've launched our small crab boat from the boat launch at hightide previously and beached it on the grass.  If the tides do not line up well with your trip, it will likely be impossible to safely launch via trailer.

### Foraging & Fishing & Shellfishing

Whalen Island provides a rich environment for harvesting food via the tidal estuary that surrounds it.  This includes fishing, crabbing, clamming.

#### Fishing
- Surf Perch
- Flounder
- Trout
- Sculpin

#### Shellfishing

The estuary envirornment hosts a number of different shellfish.  Purple Varnish Crabs are by far the easist thing to forage when the tide is low.  Dungeness Crabs can also be found at low and high tides via Crab Pots or by wading & raking for buried crabs.

- Dungeness Crab
- Purple Varnish Clams
