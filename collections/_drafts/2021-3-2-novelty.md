## Introduction

As I was writing the [Lunar New Year & the Oregon Coast](/travelouge/2021/02/20/a-quick-escape-from-portland.html) travelouge a few weeks ago, I had some reflections about the importance of [novelty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novelty), given the experience we've had over the past year working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.

While the weekend of [Lunar New Year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_New_Year) was filled with quite a bit of stress due to the snowstorm and subsequent power outage we experienced, it was also filled with novelty which served as a welcome break to the monotony that has come with working from home for nearly a year.  

As we were going through this experience, we realized how much appreciation we had for the situation, despite it's inconvenience.  This reflection led to some deeper thinking about the impact that the experience of working from home full-time—by circumstance, rather than choice—has had upon both of us.

## One year of solitude

At the onset of the [COVID-19 pandemic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic) in March 2020 in America, both mine & my partners' employers decided to close their offices to employees and transition to indefinite work-from-home.  A vast majority of firms in each of the industries we work in (software & design) chose to do the same; within our professional network remote work was soon the normalcy.  Outside of our network, we began to hear news that office-based companies had made the switch to remote.  At the time of writing, we are just over a week past the one year anniversary of this change.  

Prior to our offices being closed as a result of COVID-19, I had been working from home part time on my own volition previous to it becoming a necessity.  For my partner, the shift to remote work was indeed a novelty, given that the culture of her company puts a heavy value on in-person collaboration due to the nature of their work.  A new dynamic of this situation was that we were now both working at home at the same time, which had only ocurred sporadically before.

### The honeymoon period

With any new experience—new relationships, new jobs, new situations—there always seems be a [honeymoon period](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/honeymoon_period) during which the novelty of the situation makes it a much fun and interesting experience.  During this time any interpersonal inconveniences, frustrations, and conflicts are easily overlooked or forgiven.  Eventually, the shine of this new experience wears off and we begin to actually reckon with the impact that the change has upon us at an individual level.

Our shift to full-time remote work was initially a welcomed one; we enjoyed being able to spend more time together, the convenience not having to commute to an office via car or public transit, making more use of our home, and being able to escape some of the issues of [open plan offices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_plan).

During the warmer months the shift to us both working from home was a quite pleasant arrangement.   We were able spend time working outside, and once the work day was over we still had sunlight to spare.  The lack of a commute meant we had a lot more free time for activities that we enjoued spending more time on.  It also meant more available time to get our work done, with normal constraints removed.

During the outset of our work from home experience, there was fun aura that surrounded it.  Everyone seemed to be taking on new hobbies with the extra time that they had found; baking bread; knitting; finally taking care of their houseplants.

### Cabin fever sets in 

- not taking vacation mid-year
- not going out as much
- nature bathing
- overwork by circumstance

### Winter is coming

As the days have grew shorter and wetter, as it is wont to do in the Pacific Northwest, we moved into a predictable cycle that we have grown accustomed to during the fall and winter; spending a lot more time inside.  In previous years, fall and winter was still regularly puncuated with our commute to work, regular happy hours with friends, and other activities.  

With diminished access to the outdoors as we work, and the lack of the company of friends, we started to devolve into a montonous schedule that primarily revolved around work.

### Learning how to work remotely

Though losing power & wireless connectivity was an inconvenience, we both enjoyed the fact that it forced us to get away from our computers and mobile devices and instead spend time in front of the fire with each other.

Despite enjoying the change of pace for a few days, we became tired enough to be ready for a change of situation, especially since we had no idea when our power would return.  We had the privelege of being able to take a short trip outside of town, which we were greatful to have.

1. It's okay to plan for novelty
2. Have something to look forward to
3. Get out of your place
4. Getting outside even when it's not nice outside is important

### Planning for novelty

As counterintuitive as it seems, novelty sometimes needs to be planned for, otherwise it will not occur.  


## Notes

Recent positive developments with vaccines has caused the estimated timeline of us being able able to return to our offices at the end of 2021. 

Working from home provided me an easy way to focus on tasks, and
