Several months ago I gave a lightning-talk at [Jama Software](https://www.jamasoftware.com/) about **["The Clean Coder: A Code of Conduct for Professional Programmers"](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Coder-Conduct-Professional-Programmers/dp/0137081073)**, a book on professionalism for software engineers by [Robert C. Martin](https://sites.google.com/site/unclebobconsultingllc/) (Uncle Bob) that is a follow up to his classic book **["Clean Code: A Handbook of Agile Software Craftsmanship"](https://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882)**.  

<!--description-->
At Jama, our engineering group holds [lightning talks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_talk) once per [sprint](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/iteration/)  (every 2 weeks), where anyone in the organization invited to present on any topic (though they usually have a technical bent) for four minutes and forty seconds.  This event serves as a great way to share individual areas of continuous learning.  Given these constraints, this lightning talk just served to introduce the main premise of the book, and underscore one part that I thought was particularly useful and salient to my fellow software engineers.

The Clean Coder discusses the soft skills that a software development professional needs in order to be successful in their line of work.  These topics range with how to deal with conflicts, schedule pressures, management issues, to time-management and gumption traps.  All this to help answer the question of how we can keep not only our code clean, but the interpersonal interactions surrounding it.

The topic I chose to focus on for the balance of the lightning talk was Martin's discussion of the importance of saying "No", especially within the context of planning software projects.
