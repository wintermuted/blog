I now work at Microsoft where I am continuing as a Senior Software Engineering Manager, following it's acquisition of Xandr, Inc from AT&T

<!--description-->

The acquistion was earlier announced in December 2021 after I had just started paternity leave.  I am very excited at the outcome for me and my colleagues at Xandr following what seemed like a misadventure for several years at AT&T.
