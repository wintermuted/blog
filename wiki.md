## About

Welcome to my [personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki). I maintain this wiki to document the things
I've learned through my career & life, for personal reference and in order to share with others. The content of this
wiki is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), and free to use.

### Focuses

This wiki primarily focuses on software engineering, but also includes other things that I am interested in.
