Welcome to my [personal wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_wiki). I maintain this wiki to document the things
I've learned through my career & life, for personal reference and in order to share with others. The content of this
wiki is [open source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_source), and free to use.  If you see an error or would like to 
suggest an update or addition, please [open an issue](https://github.com/wintermuted/blog/issues/new) on [GitHub](https://github.com).

This wiki primarily focuses on software engineering, but also includes other things that I am interested in.
